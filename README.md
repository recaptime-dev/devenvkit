# devenvkit - RecapTime.dev's centralized dev environment configs

[![Build and push images](https://github.com/recaptime-dev/devenvkit/actions/workflows/docker-builds.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/recaptime-dev/devenvkit/actions/workflows/docker-builds.yml)

This project hosts the sources for our base Dev Containers images and feature
customizations, as well as Nix flakes-powered versions of them, plus templates
to get started in any project. A rework of [our previous work][devenv-old-repo]
from the [Gitpod era](https://gitpod.io) (before its rebranding to Ona years later).
